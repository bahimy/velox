HTML Academy practice template

This is one of the HTML academy's practicing templates brought to the form of the html document.

There are no images because HTML academy doesn't allow to share them.

This project is a practicing persuit and made in order to enhance coding skills so code review is very welcomed.

Modules are excluded. When deploying the project to another PC, you can run "npm install" to restore them.
